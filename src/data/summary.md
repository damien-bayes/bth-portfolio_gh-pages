# Summary

I maintained IBM DataPower gateway platforms and have been developing web applications mostly as a front-end developer using modern frameworks like Vue, React and Angular.

In addition, I really like using Node (Express.js) that accelerates my productivity as never before, however if there is really no need to use either a library or framework, then I don't. Frankly, I don't like to complicate things with 3rd party libraries and I tend to solve the problems using custom solutions and methods
